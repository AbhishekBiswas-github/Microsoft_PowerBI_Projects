# MBA Admission analysis

In this project, I analyzed key factors that influence MBA admissions and visualized the data to provide actionable insights for prospective students and admissions teams alike. Here's what the dashboard covers:

* **Admission distribution based on GMAT score and GPA** – Compare how academic performance influences admissions, with detailed breakdowns to explore trends.
* **Proportion of male and female students** – Get a clear understanding of the gender diversity within the program, highlighting areas for potential improvement.
* **Graphical analysis based on racial background** – Understand how the admissions process reflects diversity in ethnicity, providing data-driven insights for fostering an inclusive environment.
* **National vs. international students** – Explore the distribution of domestic and international students to identify patterns of global reach and diversity.
* **Industry experience and previous work sectors** – Analyze the industry background of students, helping identify which sectors contribute the most experienced candidates.

### Project Outcomes:
1. Identified patterns in admissions based on academic performance, helping set data-driven admissions criteria.
2. Revealed gaps in gender diversity, allowing schools to tailor strategies for improving gender balance.
3. Highlighted diversity in student racial and international representation, with insights on inclusivity.
4. Provided a clearer picture of students' work experience across various industries, useful for shaping cohort composition.

This project was built using advanced Power BI functionalities such as data relationships, DAX measures, and interactive visuals to create a comprehensive admissions dashboard.
